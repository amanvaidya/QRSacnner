#QRScanner<br>
#This is a bar code scanning app
#This app is integrated with ZXing library to scan barcodes
#This is the basic application in which you are connecting and submitting data to the database without any webservice or third party API.
#This app uses JSTL driver library, to connect with db.
#In case you want an app to be ready in a day, without any webservice, try this one.
#If you face any issue with the code, reach me out at amanvaidya700@gmail.com.
#Soon I'm going to provide updated version of this application integrated with REST and Retrofit.
#Happy Coding:)
